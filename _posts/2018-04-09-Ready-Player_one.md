**Ready Player One is a movie by Steven Spielberg, but based on a book written in 2011 by Ernest Cline. It is of the genre LitRPG, or so Wikipedia says, which I've never heard about. It stands for literary role playing. The book, from what I understand, is much darker than the movie, and develops the characters in a much deeper way.

I can't say I didn't expect this movie to be as it was. Spielberg is Hollywood and Hollywood is Spielberg. Each of his movies is the star child of a hollywood studio. Inflated high budget, Edgiest CGI and sound design, a cosmic star cast, and heavy marketing. The script, content, and story, is for the whole American family. PG-13, so the swear words are carefully chosen and mechanically distributed thorughout the movie to perfectly conform to the rules, which would otherwise limit the target audience for the movie, a devestating blow to a movie operating under tight profix maximization paradigms.

Despite the fact that each Spielberg movie is different -- we've had aliens (maybe more than once), dinasours, sci fi police department, and now, VR -- the themes are quite predictable: an evil guy, lots of action, youthful brevity, and romance. And indeed, by the end of the movie, you get what you want, and everything is resolved. The bad guy goes down, the world is saved, young hero gets the girl, and love wins. 

There's no denial that the movie is visually appealing. But then again, is it really a surprise that it is, given the amount of money that had gone in to this movie? Shouldn't this be expected? 

I think the more interesting question is why a movie with so many resources, can't create something truly different, daring, and creative. Why a movie with this much investment is moulded into such a predictable mould, one in which if you drop into any stage in the movie's timeline, you're at the same plot development stage as other movies having the same level of investment.

I do want to say that there were some things I enjoyed in the movie. One of them is the home town of the main character -- the post-capitalistic-esque Ohio.There was a lot of potential to dwell in this interesting world that he created, but I was let down there -- most of the movie was action scenes in the cyber-virtual game world. 

On the whole, the things the movie did well would have been totally unacceptable if they weren't: the effects, the stunning visuals, etc. But I was disappointed by the story itself. Still, I'm glad I saw it, because it's interesting to see mass media paying attention, and perhaps glorifying, virtual reality!
