###By Stanley Grauman Weinbaum

Last winter I was fortunate  to sit at Slajov Zizek's yearly
seminar at NYU. The small number of students for which this
seminar was for, I gathered, were graduate and doctoral
students of Avital Ronell.

I, of course, wasn't invited. Perhaps because I had to sneak in
every time, I can't say I soaked in much of the conversation,
which was all about virtual reality, but what did stick with
me was Zizek's continued insistence on augmentation over virtualization.
You don't have to be engaged in philosophical talks on the nature
of reality to understand what he means by this notion;
that this new technology should complement rather than supplement;
that it should lead to enhancement rather than escapism.

And this was the question that, to me, permeated Weinbaumâ€™s story.
While a great story, the year in which it is written, to me, is the truly
interesting aspect here. At a time when it was hard to imagine a technology
that could simulate reality -- note how ridiculous, in a modern sense,
Weinbaum's goggles are, with their milky liquid, their static overlayed
photographs, and their use of the professor's own body -- the one element
in the story that is almost timeless is exactly the conflict between the 
simulated and the real. 

It is said that Weinbaum's is the first story about VR. Perhaps.
I see room for the argument that his version of VR is incommensurate 
to ours. Regardless, what the story says about VR is that we never really
needed VR to discuss Zizek's notion of the struggle between augmentation 
and virtualization. It extends as far back as to Plato's Allegory of the Cave,
and in the realm of more modern philosophy it is perhaps invoked the strongest
by Heidegger's philosophy of technology. It would be interesting to uncover
more texts, stories, and theories that talk about such virtualization without
talking about VR.

In these types of conversations I often find myself using the following
quasi-historical argument: 'those worried about the societal ramifications
of technology have been pointing to the supplementation > complementation
of technologification for hundreds of years, and at each generation those 
crying against the new technology have been saying that now, more than ever, 
we are really at a breaking point. And here we are today, hearing that now, 
more than ever, we have really crossedd a threshold'. It might be that the
uniqueness of our day is more likely than the scenario that we are just repeating
history.

I packed in too many scattered thoughts into this... Oops.
