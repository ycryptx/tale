## Description
Judging by how reality-simulating technologies have been culturally imagined -- from the Stanley Weinbaum's glass spectacles to Star Trek's all-engulfing holodeck -- out of the many use-cases for virtual reality, the creation of virtual worlds seems to be prominent. 

Virtual spaces can be liberated from the spatial, economic, and legal constrictions of the physical world. They could help us imagine, experiment, and experience alternative realities, and could open the door to things we can't yet think of.

I hold that the true impact of VR would come when technology and applications are mature enough to be integrated with the internet. While the internet is a tool of communication, it can be more accurately thought of as a democratizing medium that has empowered people to connect despite geographical, sovereign, and economic boundaries. The internet has thus allowed for the distributed (and open-source) creation of code and content, a shift away from centralzied development of knowledge of immense effect. It is not hard to foresee something similar happening with VR: a distributed, community-based construction of virtual worlds.

An interesting project already exists that does this called Decentraland, and it is my task now to do more research about it:

## Vision for the project
I want to explore the question of how to incentivize the creation of valuable content in distributed virtual realities. While they have the potential to be great, as I've idealistically just said, they can become stale, and unused. This is particularly because the virtual space is infinite (well, up to a certain bound of global computing power and memory), but certainly because they don't naturally exhibit the property of finitude, which we have all around us in the physical world. 

So how would it be to introduce finitude to the virtual world? Is it even possible? Is it worth doing? Those are all questions my project would ask, and hopefully, provide clues to. 

I've met with Pasan and got a general idea of what's possible. Everything I will describe is within the limits of VR and of Unity, and of time (most importantly!). 

There would be two spaces, the finite and the infinite. The finite space would be the Chateau room, which would be a caricaturize a place that exists in scarcity (I have yet to finalize exactly what it will be, but it could be a very organized room in which space is maximized to the full efficiency with objects that would be interesting for the walker wearing the headset, or it could be a model city in a tight environment, think Hong Kong, but that would be very difficult to do). The second space would be the infinite room. It would look like Construct in the matrix 
[link](http://matrix.wikia.com/wiki/Construct?file=Matrix_Wiki_Construct.png).
the idea is that there would be an object in the distance the user could walk to, and this could go on indefinitely with randomally inputted objects. The idea is that maybe at first the room would look cool, but very soon it would become boring and tedious, and hopefully alienating too.

## Timeline:

#### Done:
1)talked to Pasan

2) Briefly looked at how to do some of my ideas in C#

#### Undone:
1) finalize finite room --> could be animated, but maybe could use VR camera (by end of February)
2) start implementing (by mid March)
3) figure out if billboarding is needed for infinite room (by end of Feb)
4) Snowcrash
5) 24 frames
