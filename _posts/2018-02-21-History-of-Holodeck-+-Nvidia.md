### History of the Holodeck
The holodeck is a technology invented by the show Star Trek, that simulates and recreates real-life scenarios with holographic projections and physical matter (by means of replicators). The room the holodeck occupies is quite small compared to the scene sizes it's able to simulate -- this is due to the 360-degree projections that capture the whole field of vision. Besides the fact that the holodeck technology is far-fetched (not just because it's almost impossible to physically recreate objects, but also because realistic projection at this scale hasn't been achieved yet), it wasn't clear how the holodeck users can maintain their respective projectino if they separate away from each other over a far virtual distance (as did happen in the show).

While the holodeck is meant for simulations and training, it seems that almost as importantly is its recreational use.
